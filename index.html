            <h2>Benzema wins Ballon D’or 2022</h2>
            <img class="right-img" src="Assets/img4.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Our team captain was named the best football player of the year.
              After years of mainly Ronaldo and Messi competing for who gets the
              Ballon D’or the majority of the time, it is time for Benzema to
              get some recognition for the amazing player he is. He scored a
              total of 44 goals and was essential in winning the Champions
              League, LaLiga title, and the Copa Del Rey during the 2021/2022
              season. Following an amazing season, he was awarded the Ballon
              D’or in which the gala was hosted in Paris. He came ahead of Sadio
              Mane, Kevin De Bruyne, and and Robert Lewandoski in a vote that
              was carried by 180 different journalists. Benzema in response of
              receiving the award stated “Holding this trophy is such an honour,
              it's a childhood dream come true. It's an individual award, but a
              team one too, and I think this is the Ballon d'Or of the people.
              Thank you to all of Madrid, to the players, because without them
              this would have been impossible, to the fans for always motivating
              me to give my best on the pitch, and to the president as well”
